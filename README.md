### Ryan Hugus

**`Data analyst (Excel/SQL/R)`**

I have always loved to solve problems. After graduating college and starting my first job, I learned about the Google Data Analytic course and earned my certificate. This taught me technical skills using excel, SQL, and R that allow me to clean and organize data in a presentable way to solve problems. I enjoy learning new skills that allow me to be a more efficient and effective problem solver.
